```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

School data I've already cleaned on the previous module: https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-schools-data/workspace/file?filename=combined.csv
School survey data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8

```{r} 
school_df <- read_csv("project-2-data/combined.csv")
survey_df1 <- read_tsv("project-2-data/masterfile11_gened_final.txt")
survey_df2 <- read_tsv("project-2-data/masterfile11_d75_final.txt")
```

Filter survey data to include observations only for high schools & select the necessary columns for the analysis
```{r} 
survey_df1_select <- survey_df1 %>% filter(schooltype == "High School") %>% select(dbn:aca_tot_11)
survey_df2_select <- survey_df2 %>% select(dbn:aca_tot_11)
```

```{r}
survey_df <- bind_rows(survey_df1_select, survey_df2_select)
```
